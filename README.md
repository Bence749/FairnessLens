## Abstract

As artificial intelligence increasingly influences critical decisions, ensuring model and dataset fairness is paramount. Our scientific research addresses the challenge of systematically visualizing and justifying the fairness of datasets and machine learning models throughout their lifecycle. We aim to bridge the gap between complex algorithms and real-world impact, empowering both model integrators and AI developers to build more equitable and transparent AI systems. We propose interactive visualizations that assess fairness without accessing sensitive attributes.

## Features

-   Systematic visualization of dataset and model fairness
-   Interactive tools for assessing fairness without sensitive attribute access
-   Tools to bridge the gap between complex algorithms and real-world AI system impacts
-   Fairness metrics throughout the machine learning model lifecycle
